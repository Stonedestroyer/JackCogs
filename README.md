Cogs created by jack1142 (Jackenmen#6607 on Discord) for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). Red-DiscordBot is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26 and the Core Developer team. Feel free to create issues, if you want to see some function in one of my cogs. If you see a bug in one of my cogs, do that as well ;)

If you're developer, you can also send pull requests and I will happily merge your commits, if it doesn't conflict with anything developed before.

Also I suggest to join [Red - Cog Support server](https://discord.gg/GET4DVk) and if you will ever need help with any of my cogs, just mention me (@Jackenmen#6607) on #support_othercogs channel.
